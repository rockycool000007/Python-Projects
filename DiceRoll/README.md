# Dice Roll

This is a project I had an idea to do late one night before bed. It came to me suddenly and I wrote down what I wanted to accomplish with the program. 

You can choose from a menu 6 types of dice to roll:

* Four-sided
* Six-sided
* Eight-sided
* Ten-sided
* Twelve-sided
* Twenty-sided

Each dice roll uses the `random` module and the `randint` method to determine the outcome of the roll. I also coded in some checks to verify the input is valid.

Once each roll is done, you are asked if you would like to re-roll the same dice. If not, then you given the choice to go back to the menu and choose another dice to roll. Or you can just stop.
