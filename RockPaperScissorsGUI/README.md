# Rock, Paper, Scissors GUI

This is a text-based game I made in JavaScript (source code here: https://github.com/bcgates82/js-projects) when I started learning Web Development in late 2016. Now I'm transforming the game into Python since I'm learning that for work. I chose this game because I believe it's a good way to implement the `if/elif/else` statements and logic.
    
As of 3/11/18 I'm making a GUI for the game using `Tkinter`.

### Changes / Updates

* 4/4/18: 
   - Destroyed the frame that holds the `winner_text` so when the player presses either the same button or a different button, the old winner text is no longer visible.
   - To get the frame to destroy and redo itself, I made the `winner_frame` variable a `global` in each function.
   - Created an offset for the window so it now shows up hopefully close to the middle of your monitor



### Bugs

* Need to fix the alignment of the text as it jumps around in the window. Or maybe I need to fix the window. I'm still troubleshooting this.
