This is a text-based game I made in JavaScript (source code here: https://github.com/bcgates82/js-projects) when I started learning Web Development in late 2016. Now I'm transforming the game into Python since I'm learning that for work. I chose this game because I believe it's a good way to implement the `if/elif/else` statements and logic.
    
As of 3/11/18 I'm making a GUI for the game using `Tkinter`.
