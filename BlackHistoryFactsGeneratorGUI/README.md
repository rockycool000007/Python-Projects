# Black History Facts Generator GUI

This is a project I made in Febuary 2017 in JavaScript (source code here: https://github.com/bcgates82/js-projects) to provide random Black History Facts for my Twitter feed. I found myself looking up random facts online and thought there had to be a better way.

The project was originally written in JavaScript and used an `array` to hold the facts, and displayed them randomly on a website using jQuery and the `random` and `Math` methods in JavaScript. In Python I'm still selecting the facts randomly using the `random` method.

### Changes / Updates

* 4/4/18:
   - This is still a work in progress. I started on this program but stopped several times to work on other programs.

* 4/30/18:
   - Changed the program to show an initial fact using tkinter's `Message` module. Upon pressing the "Next Fact" button, a new fact shows up.

### Bugs

* 4/30/18:
   - Need to change / correct the window sizing
