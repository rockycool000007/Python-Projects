# Lottery Number Picker

I made this project because I was discussing my Python training with my mom one night and was telling her how I use the `random` module to randomly pick numbers. She plays the Georgia Lottery and asked me if I could make her a lottery number generator. So that's what I did on-and-off on a Saturday.

I created two versions:

* A Georgia Lottery version
* A "generic" version for other states

To keep from generating duplicate numbers in games that won't allow duplicates, I staggered the ranges in the `random.randint`. I can improve this by maybe implementing a `for-loop` but I'm still working out the logic.
