Python projects I code as I learn the language

I'm currently learning Python as one of my development goals for work. It's a programming language I have been interested in for the past few months but now I'm serious on learning it.

I'm currently using Udemy to learn Python, using this class: Complete Python Masterclass (https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/)

As for my IDE, I use [PyCharm ](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) by JetBrains. On occasion I use IDLE3, but only when I need to review and copy code from one working program into a new program.
