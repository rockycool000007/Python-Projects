Python projects I code as I learn the language

I'm currently learning Python as one of my development goals for work. It's a programming language I have been interested in for the past few months but now I'm serious on learning it.

I'm currently using Udemy to learn Python, using this class: Complete Python Masterclass (https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/)
