Python projects I code as I learn the language

I'm currently learning Python as one of my development goals for work. It's a programming language I have been interested in for the past few months but now I'm serious on learning it.

I'm currently using Udemy to learn Python, using this class: Complete Python Masterclass (https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/)

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a text-based game I made in JavaScript (source code here: https://github.com/bcgates82/js-projects) when I started learning Web Development in late 2016. Now I'm transforming the game into Python since I'm learning that for work. I chose this game because I believe it's a good way to implement the `if/elif/else` statements and logic.

* 01/06/18: I uploaded the game with some broken logic on detecting when the user enters wrong input. But the game "worked" however.
* 10/07/18: I fixed the broken logic on detecting when the user enters wrong input and it prompts them to inputer either "r," "p," or "s."

**Upcoming Improvements**

*  ~~Add a `while` statement to the `play_again()` function to where the game will ask if you want to play again until the player inputs "n." As of right now the question is only asked once and then the game stops.~~ **I was able to achieve this by removing the `play_again()` function and keep the `if/else` statement indented into the `play_game()` function.**
* Show a running tally of the score, so to speak, for each game the player plays.

## Various Challenges for the Complete Python Masterclass

I'll upload my solutions to the challenges for the Python class I'm taking on Udemy. I do this to have a record of my solutions because sometimes I work on the challenges during my lunch break at work. It's easier to upload them to Github and continue to work on them at home since I'm working on two different computers.
