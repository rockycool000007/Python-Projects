# Text Fighter

This is a text-based game I made in JavaScript (source code here: https://github.com/bcgates82/js-projects) when I started learning Web Development in late 2016. Now I'm transforming the game into Python since I'm learning that for work. I chose this game because it's a play on the Street Fighter game, and this was a good way to work on Object Oriented Programming.
