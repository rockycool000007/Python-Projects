## Black History Facts Generator

This is a project I made in Febuary 2017 in JavaScript (source code here: https://github.com/bcgates82/js-projects) to provide random Black History Facts for my Twitter feed. I found myself looking up random facts online and thought there had to be a better way.

The project was originally written in JavaScript and used an `array` to hold the facts, and displayed them randomly on a website using jQuery and the `random` and `Math` methods in JavaScript. In Python I'm still selecting the facts randomly using the `random` method.

* 3/25/18: I'm making a GUI version for the program using Tkinter

**Upcoming Improvements**

* ~~Develop a layout for the facts. Right now it's very bare-bones~~
* ~~Have the app crawl for facts online (not sure how to build a crawler but I will learn)~~ I don't have the time at the moment to learn how to do this
* ~~Use the Twitter API to post the facts to my Twitter account (again, I sure how to do that but I'll learn)~~

I'm going to not implement posting the facts to Twitter via an API because it requires for me to make an app on Twitter with a valid website. As of right now I don't have any websites up and running as I closed them down due to time-management purposes. Since I'm busy with work and this class, I'm going to manually posts tweets to my Twitter profile from the app.
