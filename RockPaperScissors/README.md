This is a text-based game I made in JavaScript (source code here: https://github.com/bcgates82/js-projects) when I started learning Web Development in late 2016. Now I'm transforming the game into Python since I'm learning that for work. I chose this game because I believe it's a good way to implement the `if/elif/else` statements and logic.

* 01/06/18: I uploaded the game with some broken logic on detecting when the user enters wrong input. But the game "worked" however.
* 01/07/18: I fixed the broken logic on detecting when the user enters wrong input and it prompts them to inputer either "r," "p," or "s."
* 01/09/18: I'm going to leave the game as it is right now. I don't have the tally part of the game working like I want but that's something I'll work on later. Overall I'm happy with the progress.
* 3/11/18: I'm making a GUI for the game using Tkinter.

**Upcoming Improvements**

*  ~~Add a `while` statement to the `play_again()` function to where the game will ask if you want to play again until the player inputs "n." As of right now the question is only asked once and then the game stops.~~ **I was able to achieve this by removing the `play_again()` function and keep the `if/else` statement indented into the `play_game()` function.**
* Show a running tally of the score, so to speak, for each game the player plays.
