# Get To The End

This is a project I'm slowly working on to practice my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) that I'm learning in my Python class.

This project is a text-base adventure game where you fight monsters in various rooms and try to get to the end. You have to make decisions on where you go and how to progress.

### Changes / Updates

* 5/13/18:
   - Corrected some incorrectly formed logic that was causing the game to attack both enemies at once.
   - Added a test to both the `attack_bat()` and `attack_troll()` methods so if the Bat's and Troll's hitpoints are less than 1, the methods will not run.
   - For the `Troll` class, I created the `block` method which can block the player's attacks randomly.
   - Fixed typos and cleaned up formmatting in various places.


### Bugs

* None at this time.
