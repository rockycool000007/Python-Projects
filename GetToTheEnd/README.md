# Get To The End

This is a project I'm slowly working on to practice my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) that I'm learning in my Python class.

This project is a text-base adventure game where you fight monsters in various rooms and try to get to the end. You have to make decisions on where you go and how to progress.
